# MyReads Project
a simple application that uses react router and basic application state to categorize books onto shelves.
started from the template from the react nanodegree.


* install all project dependencies with `yarn`
* start the development server with `yarn start`


you can now move books into and off your 'shelves' using the controls on the `Book` components.
Your selections are saved on the books api provided by Udacity. You can add books via a
search input, though be careful, the search terms [are limited](./SEARCH_TERMS.md)
